tagline: Multi-user FROSTR signer with API keys, rate limiting, and NIP-46 nostr connect.
description: |
  Igloo Server packages the full FROSTR multi-user signing experience for Umbrel.
  It runs in "database mode" by default, with a simple elegant web UI and a fully featured API.

  - Configure the signer with your share + group credential and connect to other FROSTR signers over Nostr.
  - View a full event log in the UI for all signing and peer activity.
  - Connect to multiple Nostr clients via nostr connect (NIP-46) and set permissions per connection.
  - Issue, track, and revoke API keys for external clients.
  - Tune rate limiting, session and signing timeouts, CORS origins, and node restart/backoff (retries, delays, backoff multiplier) in Advanced Settings.
  - Relays are managed per-user in database mode so each signer can keep their own Nostr relay list.

  On Umbrel, the admin secret is auto-provisioned and validation is skipped, so you can go straight
  to creating your admin account. The Admin Secret is still visible in the Configure page if you need
  it for API calls or external clients.
